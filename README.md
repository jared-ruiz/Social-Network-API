# Challenge - 18
## Social-Network-API

- For the eighteenth challenge of my bootcamp, I am tasked with creating a full back end support for a fictional social media platform. Instead of using mysql and sequelize for the database functionality, I will be utilizing mongoDB and mongoose. I will also be utilizing virtuals and getters alongside my standard CRUD and RESTful API structure.

<br>
<br>

## User Story
---
- AS A social media startup
- I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
- SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

<br>

## Criteria to be considered complete (June. 2022)
---

GIVEN a social network API
> WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
- THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
> WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
- THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
> WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
- THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
> WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
- THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list

## Weekly Reflection
---

- This week took longer than expected and I don't know if it was because of the difficult manuvering through my first noSQL database, coming off of the stressful project 2, or if I'm getting mentally burnt out from the bootcamp. Lately I have had to physically force myself into my seat to get the most basic of tasks done with my code. I think this 6 month sprint of non stop web dev lessons is finally effecting me. I only have a few more weeks left but it is definitely burning me out. I desperately want a job in this field. I don't feel like i've mastered much but with references and time, I know I can build all of this in a way that any employer would want. So many thoughts are clouding my head at the moment. All in all, I got this done, and have another task ahead of me. Here's to another week!
